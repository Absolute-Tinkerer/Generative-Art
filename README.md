# Generative-Art
Create generative art in Python!

The only requirements here is a Python installation, such as Anaconda. Only packages that are standard to the Anaconda distribution are used here.

To run this program, execute the main file from the command line using <code>python main.py</code>.

Included in this repo are a handful of utilities and example functions to generate a couple styles of Perlin-Noise based art drawn with PyQt.QPainter. Uncomment whatever drawing you'd like to make from the <code>main.py</code> file to generate output images!
